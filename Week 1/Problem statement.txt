The stated problem is to solve a calculation maze, as explained in detail here (http://www.mazelog.com/show?15).

Given an input maze, and the target number required to exit, determine the path through the maze
starting at the top left and ending at the bottom right, in the shortest number of steps. 

Input format:
* The first line of input is an integer T, the target number to reach.
* The next N lines are individual rows of the maze, representing cells separated by spaces.
* The first cell (top left) is an integer. Subsequent cells are a mathematical operator (+, -, *) followed by an integer.

Output format:
* The first line of the output is the length in steps of the optimal solution. The starting cell counts as the first step.
* The next line of the output is the solution, formatted as described on the link above.
  * Each cell of the grid can be numbered, starting with 1 in the top left, left to right then top to bottom.
  * The solution is a space-separated list of numbered cells visited. The first number is 1, and the last is the number in the bottom right.
* (Optional) If there are multiple valid solutions, they are listed on subsequent lines, sorted alphabetically.

Valid input and output test cases are listed under the "Tests" directory.
